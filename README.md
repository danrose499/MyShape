In this project, I recreate the Java shape hierarchy with the classes MyLine, MyCircle, and MyPolygon which extend a MyShape class.
A MyColor enum is used to allow custom RGBA colors.

JavaFX is then used to print objects of these shapes onto a canvas in chosen sizes and colors. 

Each MyShape class has relevant functions. 

In the future, I will add more classes and build in more features.
