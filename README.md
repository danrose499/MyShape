In this project, I recreate the __Java__ shape hierarchy with the classes MyPoint, MyLine, MyCircle, MyPolygon, MyOval, MyRectangle, and MyArc which extend a MyShape class with a MyShapeInterface. 

A MyColor enum was written to allow custom RGBA colors.

__JavaFX__ is then used to print objects of these shapes onto a canvas in chosen sizes and colors. 

Each MyShape class has relevant functions. In the future, I plan add more shape classes and build more features.
